# Openssl to Generate CA certificates
Generate your own self-signed certificates using OpenSSL if you donâ€™t have access to a certificate authority (CA) for your organization and want to use Open Distro for Elasticsearch for non-demo purposes1. Here are the steps to generate a self-signed certificate for the root CA using OpenSSL:

Generate a private key for the root CA:
  openssl genrsa -out root-ca-key.pem 2048  
  
Next, use the key to generate a self-signed certificate for the root CA:
  openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key root-ca-key.pem -out root-ca.pem
  
The -x509 option specifies that you want a self-signed certificate rather than a certificate request. The -sha256 option sets the hash algorithm to SHA-256.
